For drawCircles- you identified all the bugs correctly, but turt.color needs to use (tColors[i]), instead i + 1, in order for the colors to go in the proper order. Wonderful, descriptive comments on mysteryScript. On randomSquares, you initialize another turtle that you don't use, so it just lingers on the screen. Your turtle also makes 10x10 squares, and it should be making 25x25. Your code looks great other than those two things, great job. For search, you're missing a statment saying the center of the search area, but your other calculations are correct. You have also skipped the tree drawing part of the assignment. Your code functions well overall, I'd just suggest a closer reading of the instructions. Great job!
